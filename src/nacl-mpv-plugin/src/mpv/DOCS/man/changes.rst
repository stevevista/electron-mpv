CHANGELOG
=========

There is no real changelog, but you can look at the following things:

* The release changelog, which should contain most user-visible changes,
  including new features and bug fixes:

  https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/releases
* The git log, which is the "real" changelog
* The file https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/interface-changes.rst
  documents changes to the command and user interface, such as options and
  properties. (It usually documents breaking changes only, additions and
  enhancements are often not listed.)
* C API changes are listed in
  https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/client-api-changes.rst
* The file ``mplayer-changes.rst`` in the ``DOCS`` sub directory on the git
  repository, which used to be in place of this section. It documents some
  changes that happened since mplayer2 forked off MPlayer. (Not updated
  anymore.)
